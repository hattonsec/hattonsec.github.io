# Operator Profile

I am a UK-based penetration tester and security researcher. My work centres on assessing web applications, internal infrastructure, and cloud environments, with experience supporting red team operations where appropriate.

I approach testing with a research mindset, focusing on understanding how systems behave under real-world conditions. Clear reporting and practical remediation are central to how I work.
